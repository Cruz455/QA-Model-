Question Answering API
This API allows you to ask questions based on the content of a specified webpage. It retrieves the webpage content, extracts relevant sections, and uses a pre-trained question-answering model to generate an answer to the provided question.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Required libraries:

requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml
transformers
gradio



You can install the required libraries using pip:
Copy codepip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml transformers gradio
Usage

Import the necessary libraries and functions from the api.py file.
Create an instance of the gr.Interface class, specifying the input and output components:
pythonCopy codeiface = gr.Interface(
    fn=answer_question,
    inputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="URL"),
        gr.Textbox(label="Question")
    ],
    outputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="Answer"),
        gr.Number(label="Confidence Score")
    ],
    title="Question Answering",
    description="Enter a URL and a question, and the model will try to answer it based on the webpage content."
)

Launch the API interface by calling the launch() method on the iface instance:
pythonCopy codeiface.launch()

Access the API through the provided URL in your web browser.

Answer Question

URL: /
Method: POST
Input:

url (string): The URL of the webpage to fetch content from.
question (string): The question to be answered based on the webpage content.


Output:

answer (string): The generated answer to the provided question.
score (float): The confidence score of the generated answer.



Functions
fetch_webpage_content(url)
Fetches the content of a webpage given its URL.

Parameters:

url (string): The URL of the webpage to fetch content from.


Returns:

content (string): The extracted text content of the webpage.
error_message (string or None): An error message if the webpage retrieval fails, otherwise None.



clean_references(answer)
Removes reference markers (e.g., [1], [2]) from the generated answer.

Parameters:

answer (string): The generated answer containing reference markers.


Returns:

cleaned_answer (string): The answer with reference markers removed.



expand_answer(context, answer)
Expands the generated answer by including additional context from the webpage content.

Parameters:

context (string): The full text content of the webpage.
answer (string): The generated answer to be expanded.


Returns:

expanded_answer (string): The expanded answer with additional context.



answer_question(url, question)
Generates an answer to a question based on the content of a specified webpage.

Parameters:

url (string): The URL of the webpage to fetch content from.
question (string): The question to be answered.


Returns:

answer (string): The generated answer to the provided question.
score (float): The confidence score of the generated answer.



Example
pythonCopy codefrom api import answer_question

url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
question = "What is Python?"

answer, score = answer_question(url, question)
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {score}")
Output:
Copy codeAnswer: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Confidence Score: 0.9876543
Note: The actual answer and confidence score may vary depending on the webpage content and the pre-trained model used.
